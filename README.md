## The Pivot - Keevahh

The Pivot is a 3 week project in Module 3 of the Turing School of Software and Design, focusing on taking an existing code base and 'pivoting' it to serve a new purpose.

I focused on managing the asset pipeline, Git workflow, and ActiveRecord database queries.

Keevahh is a micro-lending platform that allows both lenders and borrowers to interact. Borrowers are able to create a project or loan request and lenders are able to contribute to various projects.

The project specifications can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.markdown)
